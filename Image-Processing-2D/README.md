# Image-Processing-2D
- A Qt Gui that can load a small pixeled image and compute its binarised, distance transformed, histogram equalization and get pixel intensity at the required pixel, pointed to by users' mouse and show its' RGB intensity values.
- Code is written mainly in C++.
- If you want to view the actual GUI, install Qt Creator on your system.
- Run the ".pro" file. 
- If you want to view the UI seperately, open the file ui.mainwindow.
- If you want to view seperately the full linked code, open main.cpp file.
- The moc.mainwindow file is a autogenerated file by the software. Change this file is highly unrecommended.
- Xml file of the GUI also gets autogenerated.
- Any changes made in this file will also make corresponding change in the main UI structure.

*Notice: While running '.pro' or any file in your system, it will show a dialogue box which reads something 'Would you want to open this file which is genereated in another(user) server. Click on yes and proceed.*
