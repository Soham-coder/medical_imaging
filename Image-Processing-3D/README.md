# image-process-3D
 - A Qt Gui is made that can process an image and view that image along different axes, render its 3D view via ITK-SNAP and compute and gives the pixel intensity at particular 3D coordinates.
 - Code is written mainly in C++.
 - If you want to view the actual GUI install Qt Creator on your system.
 - Run the .pro file.
 - If you want to view the UI seperately, open the file ui.mainwindow. 
 - If you want to view seperately the full linked code, open main.cpp file.
 - The moc.mainwindow file is a autogenerated file by the software. Change this file is highly unrecommended. 
 - Xml file of the GUI also gets autogenerated.
 - Any changes made in this file will also make corresponding change in the main UI structure. 
 
 *Notice: While running '.pro' or any file in your system, it will show a dialogue box which reads something 'Would you want to open this file which is genereated in another(user) server. Click on yes and proceed.*
